<p>The <i>unicorn</i> is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large,
    pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead</p>
<p>In European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a white
    horse-like or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a
    goat's beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland
    creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In encyclopedias, its horn was
    described as having the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance
    times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.</p>

<h2>Classical antiquity</h2>
<p><i>Unicorns</i> are <b>not</b> found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek
    writers of
    natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and
    fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book Indika ("On India") described
    them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half (700 mm, 28 inches) in length, and colored
    white, red and black. Unicorn meat was said to be too bitter to eat.</p>
